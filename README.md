# 2016-site #

## How to install ##
Full instructions for installation are available on [ceedox](https://ury.org.uk/ceedox/computing:software:in-house:2016site:get).
If you already know what you're doing, the instructions below should suffice.

Configuration for site is located in config.toml, and you'll need a
[MyRadio](https://github.com/UniversityRadioYork/MyRadio) API key with the
requisite permissions copied into a .myradio.key file in the same directory.

Then follow the Requirements below.

## Requirements ##
Requires [Go 1.6](https://golang.org/) to compile and run, along with `sassc` to
compile the SCSS files. You may use other SASS compilers if you wish, but be
prepared for unexpected results.

Alternatively, you can use Docker alone

## Running the site ##

### Without Docker ###
```bash
$ make run # Builds scss files, and runs the server
```

### With Docker :whale: ###
```bash
$ make build-docker-image #Builds the image, will only have to be re-run if you change the Dockerfile
$ make docker #Runs the image
```


## Editor Config
There is a handy editor config file included in this repo, most editors/IDE's have support for this either natively or through a plugin, see [here](http://editorconfig.org/#download).
