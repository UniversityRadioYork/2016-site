# Getting a development environment
## Install programs
### Windows (10)
~~Just install it on Windows right?~~
* Make sure latest updates are applied
* Type "Turn windows features on or off" into the search bar and hit enter
* Tick the "Enable windows subsystem for linux" box
* Restart your computer
* Go to the windows store and install Ubuntu
* Follow the prompts to create a user etc.
* Run `sudo apt-get install update-manager-core`
* Run `sudo nano /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades`
* Change the line that starts with `Prompt` to `Prompt=normal`
* Run `sudo do-release-upgrade`
* Follow on-screen prompts
* Follow Linux instructions

### Ubuntu
 ___Probably applies to most linux distros, with subtle changes___
* Sassc: `sudo apt-get install sassc`
* Git: `sudo apt-get install git`
* Make: `sudo apt-get install make`
* Go: `sudo apt-get install golang-go`
    * As long as you have a vaguely up to date Ubuntu (16.04+) the version of Go that you can get by default will be fine, but just in case follow instructions on https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Ubuntu, add the ppa, then apt-get install required version (Check by running `go version`)
#### Golang manual install
* Go to the [[https://golang.org/dl/|Go downloads page]] and scroll to version 1.6
* Download `go1.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz`
    * To do this in terminal, visit the webpage in another browser,
    * copy the address of the link
    * Run `wget [address]`
* Open a terminal at its location and unzip the file to /usr/local: `sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz`
* Now add the following lines to the end of `~/.bashrc` to add Go to your PATH:
```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export GOPATH=~/go
```
* Run `source ~/.bashrc` to update PATH values

#### Pulling from git
* Make sure GOPATH is set (`echo $GOPATH`)
* `go get github.com/UniversityRadioYork/2016-site`
    * This downloads 2016-site to ~/go/src/github.com/UniversityRadioYork/2016-site along with all necessary dependencies
* To update your working copy of the repo, running `go get` in the 2016-site directory, but you can also checkout to a specific branch if required:
    * `git checkout this-is-a-branch-name`

#### Running the server =====
* Copy `config.toml.example` to `config.toml`
* Create a new file called `.myradio.key` and paste your [myradio api-key](https://ury.org.uk/ceedox/computing:software:in-house:myury:api#getting_a_key) into it
* Run `make run`
* Assuming there are no errors, go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser and there should be a website

### Editing files
#### Ubuntu
Trivial. Open a file editor and browse to ~/go/src/github.com/UniversityRadioYork/2016-site

#### Windows
* Windows likes to hide the actual files for the Ubuntu subsystem.
* Depending on the version of the subsystem installed, they'll be located somewhere inside `Users/<User>/AppData/` . See this AskUbuntu post for more details: https://askubuntu.com/q/759880
* Probably a good idea to make a shortcut for it somewhere in your Documents folder or similar
* After making an edit, re-run the website by pressing ctrl^c in the linux window, then type `make run` again
