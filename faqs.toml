question = "How do I listen to URY?"

question = "Wow! You’re the oldest independent licensed radio station in the UK?"

question = "Do I need to do my shows from the studios, or can I do them from home?"
answer = "In addition to two industry standard studios, we developed our own WebStudio tool last term, enabling anyone to broadcast with just a laptop, a mic, and a pair of headphones. So it is entirely possible for you to do your show without ever leaving your bedroom. You might also be able to do a show from our studios, although this will be subject to availability and social distancing requirements."

question = "I’m not certain yet that I want to join, is there somewhere I can find out more without paying my membership?"
answer = """You can join our Slack, ury.slack.com, and talk to the teams you’re interested in - each one has their own channel where the team members hang out.
If you prefer in-person chats, the best place to start is our Production Meetings! There we chat about everything shows and production of shows, and there’s almost always a member of our computing or engineering teams there too, if you’re more interested in the stuff that goes on at our station that isn’t going on air. These are every Monday at 8pm on Zoom - the details will be in our Slack, ury.slack.com, in the #production channel.
Either of these options are a great way to learn more about how we work, as well as meeting some of the people that work to keep us going - we look forward to meeting you!"""

question = "Do I need to be trained?"

answer = "Sure - many of our presenters are willing to have people come on, even just to watch - just send them a message, they don’t bite."

question = "Do you have any connections to industry?"
answer = "Yes, many of our alumni have gone on to work at companies such as the BBC and Global (think Capital, Heart, LBC, ClassicFM etc) in all areas of media, production, presenting, engineering, computing, news coverage and more. Many of our technicians have also gone on to broadcast or software engineering careers."

[[faqs]]
question = "How much time does URY take up?"
answer = "As much or as little as you want. Many of our members only do one show per week, but if you want to get more involved there’s plenty of opportunities."

[[faqs]]
question = "Can I play my own music?"
answer = "You can play any music you own, as long as you’ve bought it legally - it’ll be covered in your training. We’ve also got thousands of songs in our library already, with more added all the time, so it’s pretty likely we’ve already got what you want to play."

[[faqs]]
question = "Is there anything I need to know if I want to get involved in engineering?"
answer = "Nope, doesn’t matter if you don’t have any knowledge or experience, you learn as you go! If you want to know more, you can join our Slack, ury.slack.com, or listen to How to Break A Radio Station, our podcast all about what engineering at URY is like. It’s on our website as well as Spotify and iTunes -  check it out!"

question = "I want to help make a show, but I don’t want to actually go on air. Can I do that?"
answer = "Of course! Our Production team offers help to anyone wanting to do a show, as well as producing the bigger events URY cover throughout the year; they’re heavily involved in our coverage of YUSU’s election season, Roses as well as any Outside Broadcasts people want to do. If you have an idea for a show, but don’t want to present it yourself, come along to our Production Meetings and pitch it - someone will be willing to help you out, and the rest of our Production team will support you in production of the show. For more information, check out the #production channel on our Slack (ury.slack.com), send a message to our Production Manager, or email the Production team on production@ury.org.uk"

[[faqs]]
question = "Can I do more than one show? Do I need to pay extra?"
answer = "You can do as many shows as you want - if you see a gap on our schedule, chances are you can fill it! You only pay once, and then you’re a member for the rest of the year, no matter how many shows you do."
