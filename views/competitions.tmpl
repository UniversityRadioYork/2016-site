    <p><strong>All competitions run by University Radio York (URY) are governed by the following rules:</strong></p>
    <p>Competitions on URY will be advertised either on air, on our website (ury.org.uk) or via our social media pages. Each competition will detail how to enter the competition, quantities and specifications of prizes, and any further conditions of the competition.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Competitions are open to UK residents, who age at least 18 years old, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</li>
      <li>Competition entries are limited to 1 per person, multiple entries will only be counted as 1 entry, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</li>
      <li>Entries must receive all required information, within the given period, any incomplete or late entries will be rejected.</li>
      <li>Entries to competitions become immediate property of URY, to use freely as URY see fit without prior consent of the entrant.</li>
      <li>Once the competition has closed, each valid entry is assigned a unique number and winners will be selected randomly, unless explicitly stated otherwise. URY reserve the right to draw winners either on air, or off-air.</li>
      <li>Winners will be contacted personally either by phone, email, or the social media in which then entered the competition.
