        <p>{{.PageContext.SiteDescription}}</p>
        <p>The station is run by students for students, meaning the people behind the station understand what the listenership want to hear.</p>
        <p>With no playlist and no set format to many of our shows, our presenters have the chance to try whatever they like, as long as it's legal!</p>

      <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-3">
        <h2>Where are URY?</h2>
        <p>URY's studios lie at the very heart of the Campus in our own building at Vanbrugh College.</p>
        <p>But URY's real presence is felt outside of the studio, around the campus at major University and Student Union events, whether we're covering live music, recruiting new Freshers or reporting on major news events.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-3">
        <h2>Our Teams</h2>
        <p>Behind the scenes, the main activities involved in running the station are broken down in teams, which contain officers who are responsible for specific areas of station activity.</p>
        <p>URY is proud to have a large active membership, and encourages people to get involved, no matter what they want to do or how much time they can commit.</p>
